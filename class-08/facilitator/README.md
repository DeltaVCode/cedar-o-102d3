# Facilitators Guide: Virtualization of Windows OS

## Overview

Virtualizing Operating Systems for development and enterprise use

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we built a home network and looked at basic setup and security using Windows

**What are we focusing on today**:
In this class, we'll be creating a "Virtual Machine" with Ubuntu Linux

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on getting familiar with the command line, terminals and core OS

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to gain an understanding of what a VM is.  We'll be using Linux as the vehicle to introduce the concept of virtualization, but the focus is on VMs as a concept, not Linux itself
