“There’s a different process for accessing the BIOS or UEFI firmware settings screen on each PC. Either way, you’ll have to restart your PC."

To access your BIOS, you’ll need to press a key during the boot-up process. This key is often displayed during the boot process with a message "Press `F2` to access BIOS", "Press `<DEL>` to enter setup", or something similar. Common keys you may need to press include Delete, F1, F2, and Escape."

"Some PCs with UEFI firmware also require you to press one of these keys during the boot-up process to access the UEFI firmware settings screen. To find the exact key you need to press, consult your PC’s manual. If you built your own PC, consult your motherboard’s manual."

Why might we alter BIOS settings?

- Update firmware
- Change boot order
- Enable/disable a motherboard feature
- Adjust a power, CPU, or RAM configuration setting
- Clear the CMOS

What scenarios would prompt us to interact with BIOS?

- Motherboard malfunction requiring firmware update
- Booting into the wrong device
- Feature not configured on motherboard
- Overclocking
- Resetting the CMOS to default settings
