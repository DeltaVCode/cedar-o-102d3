# Facilitators Guide: Startup Sequences and BIOS

## Overview

Today we’re taking a closer look at the startup sequence of a computer. Familiarity with the “lower level” operations of a computer will be very relevant to a support technician who encounters various issues with computers and must isolate problems, and who also may be reconfiguring hardware components such as hard drives. This lab will be very much sandbox learning; students will likely encounter all sorts of problems.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we examined interfaces and rebuilt our lab computer

**What are we focusing on today**:
In this class, we'll be looking into the lower level software interface (The BIOS) and begin to understand how we can work with that to tweak interface settings

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on installing a fresh operating system, partitioning and file systems

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to experience and understand peripheral configuration using the computer's BIOS

## Preparation

- With your lab computer, set and reset various peripheral settings and then resume defaults.
- Be familiar with the startup sequence and where troubles may occur and how to dive in

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Lab Review

- What happened during POST?
- What components were listed?
- Did your computer boot into an operating system?

### Lecture

- [Lecture Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pp3cmpzniPrjPflQSDv2IIF2iOLN5x136CtCEpAmAOo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Lab Notes

- Students will be tweaking BIOS settings for the first time.
- Expect catastrophic failures!
- Help them assess and correct using organized steps

## What might students struggle with today?

- This is likely the first time they've ever encountered the BIOS and the notion that computers are not magic ... expect a lot of confusion as well as a lot of amazing discovery

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
