# Facilitators Guide: What is a Computer?

## Overview

Gain familiarity with core computing concepts and see the insides of a computer for the first time.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
Nowhere ...

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be focusing on the basics of how computers work, specifically in the hardware components

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on re-assembly and OS installations

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to make sure students can fearlessly, properly and safely disassemble a computer and begin to identify what they see.

## Preparation

- Practice disassembling the computer

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Review

- Run a Q&A session recapping 101 material and pre-work assignments

- **Why** (10 min)
  - There's no grey area in Cyber
  - Ethics is a huge driver for employers and businesses
  - Because we are entrusted with supporting and safeguarding computer systems containing sensitive company data and providing critical services for business operations, we are therefore beholden to a high standard of conduct, integrity, and ethics.

- **How**
  - Interactive disassembly demo --- Let's look inside!

## Lab Notes

- Students will carefully disassemble their lab PC by identifying and extracting the major hardware components
- Students should trace and draw, then photograph each component sketch next to the actual thing, paste photo into a final report/slide deck
- Emphasize to students that all actions taken should be journaled, and parts like screws documented
- Draw out a motherboard
