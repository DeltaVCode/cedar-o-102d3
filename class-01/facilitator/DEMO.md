# Demo: What is a Computer?

This hands on demo leads the students directly into the their lab, which is to disassemble and identify the parts of a computer

## Disassemble and Identify

Disassemble your lab PC, extracting and identifying all of the major hardware components. As you go through this process, identify the tools you're using and demonstrate the proper procedures to follow

- Power is disconnected
- You are wearing anti-static gloves

Talk about common interfaces and components that use them. Highlight the most important ones the students need to know.

- PCI-e
- CPU socket
- RAM slots
- Power sockets
- I/O shield in back - USB, HDMI, etc.

Make sure interfaces and components are covered by identifying the following interfaces on motherboard:

- I/O shield
- USB port
  - What version USB port are they? 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
- Ethernet port
- Video output ports
  - HDMI

- Processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Motherboard
- Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Hard drive
- Power supply
- Case
- Graphics card or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- Cooling system

Create an inventory spreadsheet or table describing the details of each component including quantity, manufacturer, age, specifications, etc.

- Lookup your PC on its manufacturer website
  - Does it list your components?
  - Can you find the manual to your motherboard?
  - How closely does the manual match your motherboard interface diagram?
  - Can you find device drivers for your components?
  - Add all the links to the spreadsheet
  - Add the inventory table to the slide deck

## Leave the PC disassembled until next class lab
