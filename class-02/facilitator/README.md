# Facilitators Guide: Build a Computer

## Overview

Today weâ€™re reassembling the lab PC that was disassembled during the class before. This is a heavily hands-on lab day that will make full use of the lab kit.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class, we introduced students to the basic concepts of how computing works at the voltage level, and had them disassemble a computer down to the parts

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be looking at the interfaces and how those parts connect and communicate with one another. Students will rebuild the computer that they previously disassembled.

**Where we're headed**:
Given a properly assembled computer, we will next be diving into the boot/startup sequence and examining the BIOS

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to have students familiar with the internal parts and connections of a properly built computer.

## Preparation

- Practice building your computer and being able to explain the parts and connections

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Warm Up

- How to create bootable Windows 10
- Students prep a USB using their own computers
  - Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation
  - Windows 10 ISO will self-install into USB, this contains all versions of Windows 10

### Lab Review

- Review the breakdown of parts on the PC
- Identification
- Tool Usage
- Q&A

## Topic 1: Build a Computer - The Parts

- **Why** (10 min)
- Relay a story about hardware and security, perhaps a time when security measures put in place were asked to be overridden for expediency or some other "business" case that was in conflict with actual security protocols.
- Have a short Q&A to discuss
- **What**
  - [Lecture Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FOUVMD4FwTxTAqEQ2l6LYWaldfFQ8LZD9ZEIbP_FNJI/edit?usp=sharing)
- **How** (30 min)
  - How do we build the computer?
  - Demonstrate a PC assembly in front of class.

## Lab Notes

Idea - Rotate students to practice documentation and inheriting scenarios
Reinforces written technical communication via instructions
Goal is for computer to boot and POST, indicate RAM, HDD, etc. is present

## What might students struggle with today?

- Bootable Windows 10 class activity took the full first hour. Mac users will encounter issues/get stuck. Maybe provide them a separate procedure w/ Etcher? 
- Windows users may issues reading the USB.
- Tell students to "click" RAM sticks. Use some force.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
