# Lab: Installing Ubuntu Linux OS

## Overview

Your home lab PC will be acting as a virtualization server for the duration of the Ops sequence. For this reason, we'll be using Ubuntu Linux as the computer's base operating system to capitalize on its lightweight, resource-efficient performance. We can later use the software application, Virtualbox, to "spin up" any other operating systems we may need, such as Windows 10.

Today you will install Ubuntu Linux 20.10 on the lab computer using the bootable USB created previously. Once Linux is installed, you will then load Virtualbox and create your first VM (virtual machine) in the form of Windows 10. This configuration will make your home lab computer highly versatile as a virtualization server. If you proceed to Ops Cybersecurity 401, this computer will ultimately become your "cyber range" system. 

## Objectives

- Download Ubuntu Linux 20.10 ISO
- Create a bootable USB of Ubuntu Linux
- Install Ubuntu Linux on your lab PC

## Resources

- [Download Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop){:target="_blank"}

## Tasks

### Part 1: Creating a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive

First, load Ubuntu Linux 20.10 into a bootable USB stick.
- Download Ubuntu Desktop.
- Download any requisite software required for creating the bootable USB stick.
- Create the bootable Ubuntu USB stick.
- Safely eject it from your personal PC and remove.

### Part 2: Installing Ubuntu

Now let's install Ubuntu onto the lab kit PC.
- A network connection will allow Ubuntu to apply software updates, so connect an Ethernet cable to from the PC to your network. 
  > If you do not have immediate access to a ethernet port, use the provided USB Wi-Fi dongle instead.
- Confirm in BIOS that your system will boot into USB over HDD if a USB is detected.
- Insert the USB into your lab kit PC with the system powered down.
- Power the lab PC on. It should launch directly into your Ubuntu installer.
- Install Ubuntu, then remove the USB drive before booting into the HDD.

Once you're accessing the Ubuntu Desktop from a normal startup, you're all set. Describe the steps taken and your outcome in the submission doc for today.
