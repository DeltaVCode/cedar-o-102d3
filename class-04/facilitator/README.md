# Facilitators Guide: Installing Ubuntu Linux OS 

## Overview

Today we’re performing a clean installation of Windows 10. In order to do so, we’ll need to understand some concepts like drive partitioning and file systems.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In previous classes, we've built a machine from scratch and dealt with the BIOS to engage the boot sequence, giving a good foundation on where an OS might sit

**What are we focusing on today**:
In this class, we'll be installing and configuring an Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on device drivers and system software designed to work with Windows and your computer hardware

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to gain a full understanding of not only how to install and setup Windows, but to really see where it sits in the layered architecture of a computer system and how, like any other component, it can be swapped out.

## Preparation

- Get familiar with creating bootable USBs and installing OS Images
- Familiarize yourself with Windows 10.

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Lab Review

- Review BIOS configurations
- Interactive Q&A on the impact of different settings
- Why might we change the drive sequence?
